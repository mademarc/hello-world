 <h2> Types of coats
</h2>
   <main>  
     
     <h3> Wire Coat
</h3>
  <p>
   Wire coated dogs like the German Pointer have fur with a wire-like texture.
This type of fur is stiff and tends to point away from the body,
 particularly on the tail and face. Maintenance of a wire coat
  requires removing old hair by hand and clipping existing hair to soften 
  it's texture over time </p>

 <aside> Double Coat
</aside>
     <p> Many longer-haired breeds of dog have double coats, meaning that
they have an undercoat that is shorter than the outer coat. The hair
is typically dense and woolly, and is more prone to shedding. Dogs with
double coats require extra attention when grooming to ensure that the
undercoat does not become matted</p>
 
 <p> A dog's coat helps them stay warm in the winter, and cool in the summer,
by providing insulation. Shaving a dog's fur in the summer is not recommended because
it can slow down the process of heat absorption. As the weather warms, dogs may shed
 their thicker winter undercoat, and grooming can help remove dead hair and
 increase air circulation near the skin.</p>

       <h2> Smooth Coat</h2>
         
       <p> Smooth coated dogs like Great Danes have silky, short hair that lays close to the
body. Smooth coated may also refer to shorter fur in breeds with multiple coat types</p>
